# ReallyPointlessRepoThatIsPointlessAsPossible

FYI I won't take any responsibility for those two little programms I wrote.
They are simply little helpers for everyday use and only work with at least Windows 10 atm

ShutdownTimer:
  just does what the name implies. It is simply a little programm that turns your computer off after a certain amount of time
  elapsed

KillProcess:
  just type in the name of the process you want to kill and add a timer if you want to
  ATTENTION:  It may be possible that you can even kill the system threads for windows, I did not try that and I advise you that
              nobody should test that. But I will change that later when I don't have to learn for tests and stuff
